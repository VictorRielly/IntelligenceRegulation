# Lane `zk60-private-block-125m` — progress ledger

Worktree `/home/victor/wt-zk60-block125m`, branch `zk60-private-block-125m`,
opened from the shared branch tip `73d3398` on 2026-09-20. ONE writer (this
delegated implementer). Everything else on the box is read-only for this lane.

Parts A and B were **purely additive**. Since 2026-09-20 the lane also works
the change list of `ZK60_PRIVATE_BLOCK_125M_LAYOUT.md` §9 — Codex has
confirmed the lane owns it, shared constants included. **This stage is S1, S2,
S4, S5** (S3 is a ruling, already made; S6–S15 are later).

**Nothing outside `hashline/src/private_block*` and
`hashline/src/private_attention*` is edited.** Running list of *shared-file
changes* (files outside those two trees), for the hand-back: **none.**

## The two parts

| Part | What | Files |
|---|---|---|
| **A** (project id **U-4**) | the zero-witness acceptance test on the TOY profile as it is: the all-zero hidden input proves and the receipt verifies from bytes; the constants and the two range boundaries the paper trace rests on are asserted so a calibration change fails loudly | `hashline/src/private_block/zero_witness_tests.rs` (new) + ONE `mod` line in `hashline/src/private_block.rs` |
| **B** | an independent, shape-driven layout model in pure Python: padded domains, plane list, A/H/M totals, opening groups, slots and receipt bytes from a shape; reproduces the toy EXACTLY or it means nothing; then the rung and the 125M shape beside the memo's [COUNTED] figures | `scripts/zk60_private_block_layout_model.py`, `tests/test_zk60_private_block_layout_model.py` (both new) |

The two ignored are the two `capture::native_capture_saved_receipt` gates (they need saved receipt paths). Toy receipt 2,816,472 B asserted by `private_block/tests.rs:108` and `zero_witness_tests.rs:172`, both in the pass list |
| **S1 split `U8_LEN` from `N`** | DONE | `…/s1-run2.log:140` — **61 passed / 0 failed / 2 ignored**; toy receipt still 2,816,472 B |

| **S4 lookup-summation repair** | — | |
| **S5 shape-driven layout** | — | |

## The toy freeze gate this stage added

`Layout::new().schedule_digest()` is absorbed into the transcript, so if it
moves every toy receipt moves — and the only existing check on it
(`tests.rs:462`) compares the layout against a freshly built layout, so BOTH
sides move together and it cannot see a change. The lane therefore pins the
digest as a LITERAL, captured on the merged tree before any S-step edit:

```
70 38 84 a8 78 02 38 8a 24 6b 27 c8 d2 39 54 67
72 c1 e8 d3 a3 9b 59 2b b8 b0 0f 8b e2 1f 8b 8d
```

`grow_tests::the_toy_schedule_digest_is_frozen`. Every step S1..S15 must leave
it untouched; a new shape is a NEW profile beside the toy (D17), never an edit
of it.

## Commands run (every one, with its log)

The Rust command, in full, is always this one (one call, output appended to a
log under `results/zk60_block125m_lane/`, read narrowly afterwards):

```
flock -w 540 /tmp/zk-build.lock env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/home/victor/wt-zk60-attention-compile/hashline/target \

## Findings

**A-F1 (PART A, the headline).** The all-zero hidden input is a valid witness
of the toy profile IN THE CODE, not only on paper: `witness::build` accepts
it, the honest prover produces a receipt, and that receipt verifies typed,
after a byte round trip, and through `verify_bytes`. **No refusal, nothing to
report as a failure.** The block output of the zero input is itself zero
(every stage annihilates), so the output endpoint commits a zero plane.

**A-F2.** The two boundary values the check found are reproduced exactly by
the module's own witness, and are now asserted with their limits:

| fact | plane(s) | value at the zero input | the limit it sits against | headroom |
|---|---|---:|---|---:|
| softmax remainder complement `sigma_s` | `A_SG0 + 256·A_SG1` | **16,383** | `sigma < 1 << WRHO_S = 16,384`, EXCLUSIVE (`witness.rs:298`) | **0** |
| softmax quotient `p` | `A_P` | **512** | `0 ..= 1 << F_P = 512`, INCLUSIVE (`witness.rs:298`) | **0** |

Both are asserted twice over: the value equals the boundary, and one more
would fall outside — so a one-bit change in `WRHO_S` or `F_E`, or turning the
inclusive quotient bound exclusive, fails this test rather than silently
invalidating the fixed input of the privacy argument.

**A-F3.** The two constants are asserted at their sources: `NORM_CEPS == 1`
(`layout.rs:54`), with `isqrt(NORM_CEPS) == 1` and the norm denominator
positive; and `exp[0] == 2^F_E` — not merely for this fixture, but as a
CONSTRUCTOR REFUSAL: `AttentionPublic::new` is shown to reject a statement
whose `exp[0]` is 0 (`private_block.rs:138`), which is what stops an
adversarially chosen public statement from destroying the fixed input.

**A-F4.** The receipt length does not move with the hidden input: the zero
witness's frame and the fixture witness's frame are both exactly 2,816,472 B,
and two proofs of the same zero witness differ in their bytes while both
verify (fresh OS randomness per attempt; the endpoint roots differ too, and
neither receipt verifies under the other attempt's endpoint policy).

**B-F1 (the model earns the right to be believed).** The model reproduces the
toy EXACTLY — all 23 numbers the Rust asserts about itself, none imported from
the crate: `A` data 213 / rows 455, `H` data 280 / rows 384, `M` 50, sites
120 / 51, opening groups 35 / 9, 23 slots and 34 functionals, 81 `A` planes
and 51 `H` planes, the per-domain U8 totals `[1024, 19456, 4608, 6656, 3072,
26624]` summing to 61,440, 2,048 exp and 512 act pairs, largest `L` 50, 159
main and 25 extension rounds, and a **2,816,472-byte** receipt. It also
reproduces the Rust's slot table `(main, ext, degree)` slot for slot and its
`A_SITES` / `H_SITES` arrays element for element.

**B-F2 (125M: no difference at all).** Every [COUNTED] figure of §2.4, §4,
§5 and §7.1 is reproduced: `A` 5,681 (5,435 data + 244 + 2), `H` 7,120
(7,018 + 100 + 2), `M` 50, sites 122 / 50, groups **36 / 9**, 98,598,912 U8
lookups (the memo's rider (a), i.e. the post-lift figure, not the 98,582,528
in its table body), largest `L` 117, and the receipt **part by part** —
`A` 21,626,880 + `H` 17,385,472 + endpoints 1,466,368 + `M` 243,712 + slots
27,456 + 136 = **40,750,024 B**, the memo's final figure. The memo's
alternative 40,747,256 B is its pre-lift, pre-support-factor variant (it
differs by exactly 752 + 2,016 B in the slot line) and the model does not
produce it.

**B-F3 (the rung: ONE difference, +176 B, diagnosed).** Every rung total of
§9a is reproduced — 83 / 52 planes, 377 / 470 data rows, 122 / 52 sites,
**623 / 576 / 50** rows, groups 36 / 9, 419,840 U8 lookups, 8,192 exp and
8,192 act pairs, largest `L` 72 at `SC_SZC` and `SC_FZC` — **except the
receipt: the model gives 4,173,208 B against the memo's 4,173,032 B.** The
whole difference is 176 B in the slot line, and its cause is named: the model
gives **`SC_KVZC` the support indicator**, because `Dom::Kv` pads at the rung
(768 true of 1,024) and §9a's own domain paragraph says it does — "the pad
rule of §3.7a is exercised on `Kv` and `F` as well (their indicators are
`supp_Kv` and `supp_F`)". An indicator is one more degree, i.e. one more
`Fp2` in each of that slot's 11 round messages: 11 × 16 B = 176 B. The memo
prices `SC_FZC`'s indicator and not `SC_KVZC`'s, and its open question 2
mentions only `SC_FZC`. **Either the rung receipt is 4,173,208 B, or `supp_Kv`
does not gate `SC_KVZC`'s inhomogeneous RoPE constraint and the domain
paragraph is wrong.** Nothing else moves: `SC_KVZC`'s `L` is 57 with the
indicator, far under the rung's largest 72, so the mask budget is untouched.
This is the only undiscussed difference the model found at any shape.

**B-F4 (the pad table of §3.7a, recounted from its own 40 rows).** The table
classifies **100 planes: 64 ZERO, 35 EXEMPT, 1 with no pad rule** (`H_U`, the
zero-sum masking pair, excluded by name). The editor's summary figures are
each true of a DIFFERENT population, which is why they do not add up:

| figure | what it actually counts | recount |
|---|---|---:|
| "62 planes" | `A` planes on the six padded domains | **62** ✓ |
| "61 proved zero" | those `A` planes ruled ZERO (the exception is `A_E`) | **61** ✓ |
| "35 exempt" | EXEMPT planes across BOTH commitments (`A_E` + 34 helpers) | **35** ✓ |

So `61 + 35 = 96 ≠ 62`: the three are not one tally. The `H` side is 38
planes (34 EXEMPT helpers, 3 ZERO table helpers, `H_U`). The table's own
claim "planes not classified here: none" CHECKS OUT: its per-domain,
per-commitment counts equal the model's 125M plane list exactly. **No plane
is missing and none is classified twice; only the summary sentence's
arithmetic is wrong.** Suggested replacement: "100 planes on six padded
domains — 64 proved zero, 35 exempt by name (the exponential pair and the 34
lookup reciprocals), and `H_U`, which carries no pad rule."

**B-F5 (a small memo/code fact worth recording).** `Dom::L` already pads AT
THE TOY: nine of its sixteen limb sub-planes carry the isqrt witness and
seven are empty (true 288 of a padded 512). The memo says so in passing
(§2.3, "its pad is not new"), but it means the toy is not a no-pad shape and
the pad rule of P-1 would apply to it the day it is written. `SC_LZC` is
homogeneous and takes no indicator, so no toy byte moves.

**B-F6 (B-3 reproduced independently).** Without the P-3 lift the LogUp sum
claim raises **three** distinct column-weight keys at both the rung —
`([],0,256)`, `([],0,512)`, `([],0,1024)`, exactly the three §9a predicts —
and at 125M (`([],0,256)`, `([],0,8192)`, `([],0,16384)`); with the lift,
one. At the toy it is one either way, so the lift is a no-op there, which is
what P-8's byte-identity gate needs. The model reports this as a separate
boolean, `logup_sum_claim_instantiable`.

**S1-F1 (one site of the memo's S1 list is classified wrongly, and the memo
contradicts itself about it).** §1.3 T-1 and the §9 S1 row both put
`argument.rs:898` — `SC_ZS`'s all-ones public vector — among the sites whose
`N` means "the size of the 256-entry lookup tables", i.e. they ask for
`U8_LEN`. **It is neither the table size nor the row width: it is the length
of `SC_ZS`'s own cube, `h_dom(H_U) = Dom::Tab`** (`layout.rs:242-251`, the
`_ =>` arm), and `run_slot`'s table-length check (`argument.rs:281-283`)
compares it against `1 << SLOTS[SC_ZS].0`. The memo's own §4.1 says so: with
the P-3 lift "`SC_TAB`'s and `SC_ZS`'s [main rounds go] 8 -> 14", which only
happens if that vector follows `Dom::Tab`, not a frozen 256. Written as
`U8_LEN` it would refuse the first proof at any shape where the lift moves
`Dom::Tab`. **Implemented as `Dom::Tab.len()`**, which is 256 at the toy — so
no byte moves — and grows with the lift at S4. The other ten sites are as the
memo lists them. Worth a one-line correction in §1.3 T-1 and the §9 S1 row.

**S1-F2 (what "byte-identical" can and cannot mean here).** A toy proof's
bytes differ run to run: `ZkRng::from_os` draws fresh randomness per attempt
(finding A-F4). The enforceable freeze is therefore *length* +
*schedule digest* + the whole test filter, and the only one of those three
that was not actually checked was the digest — `tests.rs:462` compares a
layout against a freshly built layout, so both sides move together. The lane
pinned it as a literal (above). That gate is what S4 and S5 are measured
against.

**No disagreement between the memo's rules and `layout.rs` was found at the
toy shape**: every rule the memo states reproduces the Rust's own numbers.
The differences above are all at shapes that do not exist yet.

Nothing is written outside this worktree, and no witness value, salt or
private plane appears in any evidence file: counts, sizes, booleans and
digests only. A zero-witness proof that verifies is a PRECONDITION for the
privacy argument, not a privacy result.

## NEXT

S2 (free the witness and lookup buffers after their last use, the point after
`protocol.rs:351` in the memo numbering), then S4 (the lookup-summation
repair, failing test first), then S5 (the shape-driven layout).
