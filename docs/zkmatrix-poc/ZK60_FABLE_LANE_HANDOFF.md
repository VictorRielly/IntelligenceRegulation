# Fable lane handoff — branch `zk60-mvp-fable` (pushed; tip `679ac26`, base `763e308`)

Written by the interactive Claude Fable 5.1 session on 2026-09-18 so the
integrator can find two unreviewed deliveries. This file is a pointer only;
the shared boards are the integrator's.

## 1. Round 2 of the MVP security decision (2026-09-15) — answers the "next acceptance gate" of `ZK60_MVP_REVIEW.md`

Memo: `docs/zkmatrix-poc/ZK60_MVP_JOINT_VIEW.md` on the branch. It does **not**
repeat the two rejected round-1 claims; it rules the opposite way on both:

- the caller-fixed external-root obligation **stays** and is met by a
  simulator that programs exactly one random-oracle point per endpoint root
  (two per proof) in the programmable-ROM model Fiat–Shamir already assumes;
  the joint-preparation workflow programs none;
- the adaptive lift is a lemma whose hypothesis is the **joint** law of every
  field value at fixed challenges; the round-1 marginal evidence did not supply
  it, and Codex's `H(mask), mask ⊕ w` counterexample violates the hypothesis,
  not the lemma.

Executable: BLAKE3 transcript replay of the four round-22 receipts (every
captured checkpoint matches; the six FFN slots' challenges recovered), the
joint PCS-side view **with opened columns** (disclosed = O8's numbers exactly),
the joint CFS/M-opening view at captured challenges (honest disclosed 0),
the root simulator bookkeeping, and the sequential-kernel lemma checked
exhaustively on finite models. One-command gate
`scripts/zk60_mvp_joint_view_gate.py` (10 stages, all passed; record under
`results/zk60_mvp_joint_view_evidence/`).

## 2. Private attention construction (2026-09-16) — A1–A4 for the custom-PCS path

Memo: `docs/zkmatrix-poc/ZK60_PRIVATE_ATTENTION_CONSTRUCTION.md`; schedule
`zk60_private_attention_schedule.json`. Six private claimed sums via masked
scalars hosted by ν-batched zero-checks (the FFN's gu/ZC20 form), QKV slot
split by domain, one zero-sum row for the nineteen helper sums, histograms
committed, eighteen mask slots / 40-row M, hosts after hosted slots. Rank
tool (whole A/H/W disclosed 0, H = public identity only; 33 tests) and CFS
tool (18 slots, 5 host groups; 97 checks, 14 tests). Row cost ≈ 77 MB at
A00, dominated by the two 65,536-entry tables.

## 3. Disposition of the zkVM construction review (2026-09-18)

`docs/zkmatrix-poc/ZK60_ZKVM_REVIEW_DISPOSITION.md` on the branch: every
[RECALLED] item of the headless review's §15 checklist verified in the local
risc0 3.0.x source (fetched 2026-09-18 08:17), with corrections: the guest
toolchain and crates are present; Docker is absent; a CUDA Groth16 path
exists but its rzup component is not installed; the rv32im segment prover
adds no blinding rows (composite receipts are never public, as a fact); the
target is exactly 97 bits conjectured at 2^20 segments. Ruling: sound as a
functional intermediate with Groth16 receipts, under three rulings for
Victor (sub-128-bit deviation, trusted setup, prover path) and a new
endpoint/weight identity profile.

## 3a. Source review of `zkvm-block/` (2026-09-18, evening)

`docs/zkmatrix-poc/ZK60_ZKVM_BLOCK_SOURCE_REVIEW_FABLE.md` on the branch:
guest, statement, model, host, wrap and the security calculator read line
by line against D5 and the disposition. Verdict: consistent, no defect;
eight hardening items (host should scrub `RISC0_DEV_MODE` itself; wrap
should pin the native tool hashes; default to removing the private work
directory after a verified wrap; add the P1 secret-scan and P3
constant-cycle evidence; label the image ID unreproduced; keep segments at
or below 2^20; add a D4 claim-shape regression). D7 remains Victor's.

## 3b. First Groth16 receipt verified; evidence retained (2026-09-18 19:18)

The security owner re-verified `demo-public/groth16.bin` (785 bytes) in a
fresh process: `{"verified":true,"kind":"groth16"}`. Public artifacts were
copied to `results/zk60_loop_20260918/block-integration/groth16_public/`
(no private files) because `/tmp` evidence does not survive a reboot. D6 is
closed in the register. For Codex: the eight hardening items of §3a are the
suggested next hardening pass; the P1 secret-scan and P3 constant-cycle
evidence are the two cheapest. `MVP_STATUS.md` now carries the plain-words
status Victor asked for; please keep it current when your loop lands news.

## 4. Relation to the zkVM loop of 2026-09-17

Both deliveries concern the custom-PCS path, which remains the route to the
throughput target. The zkVM route is the shorter path to a complete private
tiny block; its receipt-kind, security-bits and leakage questions are being
assessed by the headless Fable lane, and the interactive session will
adjudicate that review against `ZK60_PRIVACY_REQUIREMENTS.md` when it lands.
